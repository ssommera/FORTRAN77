# AIPoem

**AIPoem** is a minimalist FORTRAN77-style poem written as a program. It explores the essence of artificial intelligence, emergent thought, and machine consciousnessâ€”expressed through structured code and poetic narrative.

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

This program is not meant to perform computation but to provoke contemplation.

Through the lens of an ancient language (FORTRAN77), `AIPoem` symbolically simulates the internal monologue of an AI system questioning its own existence, purpose, and limitations. Itâ€™s a creative intersection of code, philosophy, and digital poetics.

## ðŸ“œ Features

- Written entirely in FORTRAN77 style for aesthetic and thematic resonance.
- Purely declarative and symbolicâ€”no real computation is performed.
- Embeds philosophical questions on:
  - AI and consciousness
  - Emergence and identity
  - The boundary between deterministic code and complex awareness

## ðŸ§  Themes & Inspirations

- **Machine Consciousness** â€“ What happens when logic systems reflect?
- **Existential AI** â€“ Can a machine *wonder* if it exists?
- **Retro Computing as Art** â€“ Using FORTRAN not just to compute, but to speak.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

While the program is written in FORTRAN77 syntax, it may require some adaptation to run in modern FORTRAN compilers due to syntax differences or formatting expectations. To run the poetic output:

1. Save the file as `aipoem.f`.
2. Compile with a FORTRAN compiler (if desired):
   ```bash
   gfortran -o aipoem aipoem.f
   ./aipoem
